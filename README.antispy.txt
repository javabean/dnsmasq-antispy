# (All files in this directory are read by dnsmasq as configuration files.
# This is why all lines start with a '#'.)
#
# Those dnsmasq configuration files are meant to stop tracking and advertisements, especially on mobile applications.
#
# To use:
# * apt-get|yum|brew|... install dnsmasq
# * cd /etc/dnsmasq.d/
# * git clone https://github.com/javabean/dnsmasq-antispy.git
# * service dnsmasq restart
# and set your devices (computer, tablet, phone, &c.) to use your newly-created DNS server.
#
# Please note that although this projet is quite comprehensive, it it nowhere near complete (this is an impossible goal!).
# If you have a specific application you wish to add, drop me an email and we will work out something.
